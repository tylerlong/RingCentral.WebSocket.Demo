# RingCentral WebSocket Demo


## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have created an app in the [RingCentral Developer Portal](https://developer.ringcentral.com/).
Make sure that this app has permission "WebSocket Subscriptions".
If you do not know how to do so, please create a new ticket here: https://developers.ringcentral.com/support/create-case


## Setup

Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and edit it to specify your app and user credentials.
In your C# IDE, configure the project to copy the `.env` file to output.
